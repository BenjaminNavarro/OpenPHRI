Disclamer
=========

OpenPHRI has been through a lot of changes recently so the Python bindings are not up to date and can't be used at the moment.

Also, the documentation is currently being written and can be found on [GitBook](https://openphri.gitbook.io/core). 

Once the documentation is finished and the Python bindings are updated, the V1.0.0 will be released. In the meantime, don't easitate to create an issue if something requires a fix or some explanations or if you find that something is missing from the library.

Overview
=========

OpenPHRI: a generic framework to easily and safely control robots in interactions with humans.

For an overview of the library, you can check the related [Robotics and Automation Magazine article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/100/4600619/08360398.pdf), but keep in mind that the library went through some changes since its writing and so some parts might not be up-to-date.

The license that applies to the whole package content is **GNULGPL**. Please look at the license.txt file at the root of this repository.
