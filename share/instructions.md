For a quick install of OpenPHRI, jump to the [Standalone install](#standalone-install) section.

For an overview of the library, you can check the related [Robotics and Automation Magazine article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/100/4600619/08360398.pdf), but keep in mind that the library went through some changes since its writing and so some parts might not be up-to-date.

You can find the documentation (work in progress) about OpenPHRI in this [Gitbook](https://openphri.gitbook.io/core).

DISCLAMER: version 1.0, the current release, has lots of improvements compared to initial release (0.x), but the Python bindings haven't been updated and so cannot be used. Since a version 2.0 with major usability improvements is on its way, the 1.0 will not be updated except for potential bugs fixes. Python bindings will be back with 2.0.
