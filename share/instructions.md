DISCLAMER: version 1.0, the current release, has lots of improvements compared to initial release (0.x), but the Python bindings haven't been updated and so cannot be used. Since a version 2.0 with major usability improvements is on its way, the 1.0 will not be updated except for potential bugs fixes. Python bindings will be back with 2.0.
