For an overview of the library, you can check the related [Robotics and Automation Magazine article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/100/4600619/08360398.pdf), but keep in mind that the library went through some changes since its writing and so some parts might not be up-to-date.

You can find the documentation (work in progress) about OpenPHRI in this [Gitbook](https://openphri.gitbook.io/core).

The license that applies to the whole package content is **GNULGPL**. Please look at the license.txt file at the root of this repository.
