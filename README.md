OpenPHRI: a generic framework to easily and safely control robots in interactions with humans

Disclamer
=========

OpenPHRI has been through a lot of changes recently so the Python bindings are not up to date and can't be used at the moment.

Also, the documentation is currently being written and can be found on [GitBook](https://openphri.gitbook.io/core). 

Once the documentation is finished and the Python bindings are updated, the V1.0.0 will be released. In the meantime, don't easitate to create an issue if something requires a fix or some explanations or if you find that something is missing from the library.

OpenPHRI: a generic framework to easily and safely control robots in interactions with humans.

For an overview of the library, you can check the related [Robotics and Automation Magazine article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/100/4600619/08360398.pdf), but keep in mind that the library went through some changes since its writing and so some parts might not be up-to-date.

Installation and Usage
=======================

The detailed procedures for installing the open-phri package and for using its components is based on the [PID](http://pid.lirmm.net/pid-framework/pages/install.html) build and deployment system called PID. Just follow and read the links to understand how to install, use and call its API and/or applications.

For a quick installation:

## Installing the project into an existing PID workspace

To get last version :
 ```
cd <path to pid workspace>/pid
make deploy package=open-phri
```

To get a specific version of the package :
 ```
cd <path to pid workspace>/pid
make deploy package=open-phri version=<version number>
```

## Standalone install
 ```
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminNavarro/open-phri.git
cd open-phri
```

Then run the adequate install script depending on your system. For instance on linux:
```
sh share/install/standalone_install.sh
```

The pkg-config tool can be used to get all links and compilation flags for the libraries defined inthe project. To let pkg-config know these libraries, read the last output of the install_script and apply the given command. It consists in setting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH, for instance on linux do:
```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<path to open-phri>/binaries/pid-workspace/share/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
```

Then, to get compilation flags run:

```
pkg-config --static --cflags open-phri_<name of library>
```

To get linker flags run:

```
pkg-config --static --libs open-phri_<name of library>
```
