List of things to be done (decreasing priority):
    - Update MassGenerator (and others that don't use spatial transforms) to mach with StiffnessGenerator. Maybe try to find a way to generalize the process => add the robot into the generators and add a constructor parameter to express things into the TCP or Base frame
    - Improve the trajectory generator to easily work on vectors + constraints on the norm of the linear and angular velocities + optional trajectory recomputation when resuming from path following
    - Use quaternions instead of euler angles to represent the orientation
    - Update the python bindings & tests
    - Make a ROS package with a service system to reconfigure the controller online
