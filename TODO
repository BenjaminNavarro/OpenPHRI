List of things to be done (decreasing priority):
    - Improve the trajectory generator to easily work on vectors + constraints on the norm of the linear and angular velocities + optional trajectory recomputation when resuming from path following
    - Create and use data types (Pose, Twist, Acceleration) that hold their reference frame + use quaternions instead of euler angles to represent the orientation
    - Update the python bindings & tests
    - Make a ROS package with a service system to reconfigure the controller online
