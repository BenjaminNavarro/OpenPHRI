List of things to be done (decreasing priority):
    - Trajectory generator: try to constrain on the norm of the linear and angular velocities
    - Provide an easy way to use one of the 4 modes of the ISO/TS 15066
    - Update the python bindings & tests
    - Make a ROS package with a service system to reconfigure the controller online
